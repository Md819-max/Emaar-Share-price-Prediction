Emaar Share Price Prediction
This project predicts Emaar Properties' share prices using machine learning and deep learning models, built and executed in Google Colab.

Project Overview
Goal: Forecast Emaar's share prices for July 21â€“26.

Environment: Google Colab Notebook.

Notebook: Emaar_share_price_prediction_july_21_to_26.ipynb

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning in Colab.

Visualization of historical price trends.

Implementation of machine learning algorithms:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Decision Trees

KNN

Deep Learning Models (Regression & Classification)

Model performance evaluation (accuracy, RMSE).

Tools & Libraries
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Notebook Platform: Google Colab

How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab:

Upload the .ipynb file from this repository to your Google Drive.

Open it with Google Colab.

Install dependencies (if not pre-installed):

python
Copy
Edit
!pip install scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
Run all cells to generate predictions.

Future Work
Add LSTM for time-series forecasting.

Integrate real-time data fetching from stock APIs.

Deploy predictions via a simple web dashboard.
